### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm 27 y.o. with +10y of experience, I awoke an interest in computers and the internet at 14 and started developing for the web at 15.

I worked on many projects developing interfaces, years as a WordPress Developer, creating custom themes and plugins. For the last 6 years I've been dedicating myself exclusively to the front-end and the entire node.js universe. I love to experiment new technologies and tools. Always learning ðŸŒ±
