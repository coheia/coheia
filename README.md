### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm 27 y.o with +10y of experience, I awoke an interest in computers and the internet at 14 and started developing for the web at 15.

I worked on many projects developing interfaces, years as a WordPress Developer, creating custom themes and plugins. For the last 6 years I've been dedicating myself exclusively to the front-end and the entire node.js universe. I love to experiment new technologies and tools. Always learning ðŸŒ±
Currently I'm working with Web Components, focused on architecture and implementation of a Design System, automating the development processes, documentation, and distribution of components to be reusable between different teams with different stacks.
I'm looking to collaborate with projects focused on web components and building/architecting design systems. If you are hiring let's talk a little bit about that.
