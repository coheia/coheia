### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I was born and raised in the metropolitan region of Salvador, Brazil, I awoke an interest in computers and the internet at 14 and started developing for the web at 15.

I worked on many projects developing interfaces, years as a WordPress Developer, creating custom themes and plugins. I have +10 years of experience developing interfaces. For the last 6 years I've been dedicating myself exclusively to the front-end and the entire node.js universe to automate routines that were once exhausting. I'm passionate about the new and I love to experiment new technologies and tools.

Always learning ðŸŒ±

Currently I'm working with Web Components, focused on architecture and implementation of a Design System, automating the development processes, documentation, and distribution of components, so that it is scalable and reusable between different teams, that use different frameworks for web development.

I'm looking to collaborate with projects focused on web components and building/architecting design systems. If you are hiring let's talk a little bit about that.
